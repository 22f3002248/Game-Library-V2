## Hello World!

\newpage
**Hello World!** Today I am learning \LaTeX. \LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in-line math such as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. I can also give equations their own space:

$$
\gamma^2 + \theta^2 = \omega^2
$$

If I do not leave any blank lines, \LaTeX{} will continue this text without making it into a new paragraph.
