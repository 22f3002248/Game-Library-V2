6. Statistics and Analytics:
   - Generate charts and reports using Matplotlib for real-time game analytics.
   
7. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure a responsive UI using Bootstrap, working on both desktop and mobile platforms.

 IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
 Game Library Project

 1. Introduction

 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the game library project, which enables users to search, borrow, and return games from a digital game library. Admins will manage the system by adding new games, updating game details, and generating statistics and reports.

 1.2 Scope
This project will be a web-based platform for managing a game library. It will allow users to browse available games, borrow them, and receive notifications for overdue items. Admins will be able to manage the inventory of games, view statistics, and restock items. The system will provide reporting capabilities and API access for external tools.

 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Admin: A user with the ability to manage the system (games, categories, users)
- User: A regular user who can search, borrow, and return games
- API: Application Programming Interface
- ORM: Object-Relational Mapping (SQLAlchemy/Django ORM)

 1.4 References
- IEEE Std 830-1998, IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications
- Flask Documentation (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- Django Documentation (https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- SQLAlchemy Documentation (https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

 1.5 Overview
This document contains the system’s functional and non-functional requirements, detailing the software, hardware, and system requirements needed to build and maintain the game library system.

 2. Overall Description

 2.1 Product Perspective
The game library system is a standalone application that allows users to search for games by categories, borrow them, and receive reminders for overdue items. Admins manage the library's inventory and monitor user activities.

 2.2 Product Features
- Game search and filter based on categories (genre, platform, developer)
- Game borrowing and return system
- Admin dashboard for CRUD operations on game inventory
- Analytics and reporting (statistics on game borrowing trends)
- API access for command-line or external system interaction

 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- Admin: Full access to all system features, including game management and reporting.
- User: Regular users who can view, borrow, and return games but cannot manage the system.

 2.4 Operating Environment
The system will run on modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. The server environment requires Python 3.x with Flask or Django as the web framework.

 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- SQLite is the primary database used for development.
- Bootstrap is used for UI styling and design; no other CSS framework is allowed.
- Redis is required for caching and Celery for background tasks.

 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have access to the internet and modern browsers.
- Redis and Celery are set up for background tasks (e.g., notifications).
- The system is designed to scale with modular components.
